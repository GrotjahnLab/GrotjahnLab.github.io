Hemanth is a rising sophomore pursuing his undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Neuroscience from Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. 

Currently, Hemanth is interning at the Grotjahn Lab, where he is developing a comprehensive dashboard application. A tool designed to streamline the storage, management and navigation of experinmental data. Additionally, he is actively involved in testing various computational tools essential for ongoing projects within the lab.

Hemanth's research interests span the fields of aging, artificial intelligence, and medical technology. Driven by a simple yet profound mission: solve complex, non-obvious problems that uplift and transform human lives. Outside the lab he enjoys writing and rock climbing. Occassionally building fun little coding projects at 2 am jamming to telugu melodies.

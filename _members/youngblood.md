Marina earned her BSc in Cellular and Molecular Biology from the University of La Verne and graduated from the Honors Program. She conducted her senior thesis research in the lab of Stacey Darling-Novak where she studied first leaf formation in S. plicata identifying novel auxin-mediated genes.

Marina spent four years in industry at Lumos Diagnostics, Cibus and the San Diego County Public Health Lab before joining the Grotjahn and Williamson labs. The labs began their collaboration in 2019 and Marina is currently using cryo-electron tomography to visualize ribosomal intermediates in E.coli. She is also an aspiring plant biologist applying to PhD programs. 

Outside of research, Marina loves to spend time with her cats, make pies, camp, compost, and grow odd vegetables.

Ben earned his PhD in James Fraser's lab at UCSF, where he developed software tools for data analysis and validation in structural biology, as well as experimentally investigating the mechanisms by which mammalian chitinases processively hydrolyze the prevalent polysaccharide chitin. Prior to that, as an undergraduate in Elizabeth Sattelyâ€™s lab at Stanford University, he investigated bacterial degradation of the polymer lignin. Before joining the Grotjahn lab, he worked at Genentech, where he developed software tools to automate processing of data from single particle cryo-EM.


Ben is interested in understanding how protein structure and function is impacted by cellular contexts. His work in the lab focuses on using _in situ_ cryoelectron tomography to determine both structure and cellular localization in parallel, and to understand how protein structure changes in different cellular environments. He is particularly interested the regulation and function of proteins that polymerize in cells.


Outside of research, he is obsessed with finding the perfect cup of coffee, a quest that has included learning to roast his own coffee beans.

Ben is supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/).

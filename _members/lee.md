Joan received her undergraduate degree in Biochemistry/Chemistry, with the highest departmental honors, from the University of California, San Diego. During her undergraduate research, she studied the binding affinity between NFÎºB and transcription coactivators, such as ribosomal protein S3, and their binding affinity with various DNA using biochemical techniques.

Joan is now a joint research assistant in the Grotjahn and Williamson Labs at Scripps Research Institute, where she uses cryo-electron tomography to study ribosomal intermediates in E.coli.

Outside of research, Joan enjoys playing the piano, learning new choreographies, going to escape rooms with friends, and putting puzzles together.

Philipp received his Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry with distinction from the Goethe University Frankfurt in Germany. During his bachelor thesis, he used isothermal titration calorimetry to study avidity effects of a DARPin dimer against the p63/p73 herterotetramer.

He then went on to the Ludwig-Maximilian-University (LMU) in Munich to join their master program in biochemistry. There, he focused on structural biology and biophysics during internships in the labs of [Johannes Stigler](https://www.genzentrum.uni-muenchen.de/research-groups/stigler/index.html) and [Karl-Peter Hopfner](https://www.genzentrum.uni-muenchen.de/research-groups/hopfner/index.html).
 
Philipp now has joined the Grotjahn lab at the Scripps Research Institute for his master thesis, where he is excited to learn more about cryo-electron tomography and the mitochondrial fission machinery.

Outside of research, Philipp is an enthusiastic soccer player and enjoys hiking and skiing.

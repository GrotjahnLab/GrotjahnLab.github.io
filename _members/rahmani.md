Hamid got his BSc in Physics from University of Tehran in Iran. He went to FSU for his PhD where he worked on Ultrafast Electron Diffraction before moving to cryoEM field in Kenneth Taylor's Lab.
  
His PhD was focused on the myosin coiled coil structure from the giant water bug (_Lethocerus indicus_) using single particle reconstruction and he is very pround of his _de novo_, 1600A long atomic model [7KOG](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7KOG).
  
He joined the Grotjahn lab as a postdoc to learn cryo-electron tomography and _in situ_ studies of mitochondrial membrane. He is interested in understanding the molecular interactions that mediate membrane constriction as well as the topology of mitochondrial membrane-embedded proteins.
  
Outside of research, Hamid enjoys running, reading, and [Iranian music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDvCxNChmjo&ab_channel=Sanatal%C4%B1k).

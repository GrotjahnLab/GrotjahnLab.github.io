Michaela received her undergraduate degree in Biochemistry and Cell Biology from the University of California, San Diego. She conducted her undergraduate and post-baccalaureate research at the Salk Institute in the lab of [Dmitry Lyumkis](https://lyumkis.salk.edu/). In the lab, she utilized biochemical and single particle cryogenic electron microscopy techniques to better understand the process of gamma retroviral integration.


Michaela joined the Grotjahn Lab at the Scripps Research Institute for her PhD, where she is interested in using the cellular cryogenic electron tomography to investigate the morphological changes in mitochondria in response to cellular stress.


Outside of lab, Michaela is a classically trained double bassist, an avid reader, a weekend hiker, and a foodie.

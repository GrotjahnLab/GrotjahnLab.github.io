Dan earned his undergraduate degree in Biochemistry from California State University, Los Angeles. He completed his honors thesis in the [Zurita-Lopez lab](https://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/zuritalopezlab), studying histone tail post-translational modifications using biochemical techniques. He then went on to work as a research assistant in the [Rodriguez lab](http://rodriguez.chem.ucla.edu/) at University of California, Los Angeles. There, he utilized structural and biochemical techniques to study broadly neutralizing antibodies against New World Hemorrhagic Fever Arena Viruses.


Dan is now a joint PhD student in the Grotjahn and [Wiseman](https://wiseman.scripps.edu/) Labs at Scripps Research Institute, where he uses cryo-electron tomography and biochemical approaches to investigate the molecular mechanisms that regulate mitochondrial morphology in response to cellular stress.


Outside of research, Dan enjoys skating, photography, grubbing with the homies, and hanging out with his cat and doggo.

Danielle attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison for her undergraduate degree and completed her honors thesis in the lab of [Francisco Pelegri](https://pelegri.genetics.wisc.edu/). This experience sparked Danielleâ€™s fascination with the microscopic world as she developed a system to visualize microtubule dynamics in developing zebrafish embryos.

Danielle moved to sunny San Diego, California in 2013 to start her graduate work in [The Scripps Research Graduate Program](https://education.scripps.edu/graduate/doctoral-program/) in the lab of [Gabe Lander](http://www.lander-lab.com/). She used cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging approaches to solve the [first three-dimensional structure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29416113) of the large, flexible, multi-subunit cytoplasmic dynein complex bound to microtubules.

In 2018, Danielle received the [Harold M. Weintraub Graduate Student Award](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/releases/2018/03/fred-hutch-announces-2018-harold-m-weintraub-graduate-student-award-recipients.html), completed her [PhD](https://education.scripps.edu/graduate/about-the-graduate-school/statistics/?tab-3-contact=1), and accepted an independent research position in the [Scripps Fellows program](https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2018/20181107-scripps-fellows-program.html). She completed a short visiting postdoctoral position at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in the lab of [Grant Jensen](https://jensenlab.caltech.edu/people/) to train on cutting-edge instrumentation in the exciting and emerging field of cellular cryo-electron tomography before applying these advanced methodologies to her own independent research.

Danielle returned to Scripps Research in 2019 to start her lab as a [faculty member](https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/grotjahn/) in the Department of [Integrative Structural and Computational Biology](https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/research-departments/integrative-structural-and-computational-biology/) and received a promotion to Assistant Professor in 2021. Danielle was awarded consecutive Damon Runyon-Rachleff Innovator Awards from the Damon Runyon Cancer Foundation in [2021](https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/blog/read/index.php?id=577) and [2023](https://magazine.scripps.edu/awards-and-honors/2023/online-exclusive/danielle-grotjahn-granted-second-damon-runyon-rachleff-innovation-award/), and the [Baxter Young Investigator Award](https://magazine.scripps.edu/awards-and-honors/2022/online-exclusive/two-scripps-research-faculty-receive-baxter-young-investigator-awards/) in 2022. Danielle was named a [Pew Scholar in the Biomedical Sciences](https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2023/20230613-grotjahn-pew.html) in 2023. 

In addition to exciting pursuits in the lab, Danielle is co-director of the Scripps Graduate Cell Biology course, a low-key yogi, a lifelong Deadhead, and a [Michael Scott](https://www.indiewire.com/2015/03/the-office-10-years-later-why-michael-scott-is-one-of-the-most-original-characters-of-all-time-248114/) aficionado.

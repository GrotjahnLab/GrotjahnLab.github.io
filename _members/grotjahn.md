Danielle attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison for her undergraduate degree and completed her [honors thesis](https://cals.wisc.edu/academics/undergraduate-students/outside-the-classroom/honors-program/honors-in-research/)  in the lab of [Francisco Pelegri](https://pelegri.webhosting.cals.wisc.edu/). This experience sparked Danielle’s fascination with the microscopic world as she developed a system to visualize microtubule dynamics in developing zebrafish embryos. After graduation, Danielle continued to work in the Pelegri lab as a technician, where she further refined her skills in microscopy and genetics to characterize the localization patterns of the dorsal-axis determinant, [glutamate receptor interacting protein 2a](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24967891).


After spending her adolescence and early adulthood braving frigid Wisconsin winters, Danielle moved to sunny San Diego, California in 2013 to start her graduate work in [The Scripps Research Graduate Program](https://education.scripps.edu/graduate/doctoral-program/) in the lab of [Gabe Lander](http://www.lander-lab.com/). Over the next five years, Danielle enthusiastically seized the opportunity to establish a cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging pipeline within the institute, and utilized these techniques to solve the [first three-dimensional structure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29416113) of the large, flexible, multi-subunit cytoplasmic [dynein](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285262) complex bound to microtubules.



In 2018, Danielle [received](https://education.scripps.edu/graduate/about-the-graduate-school/statistics/?tab-3-contact=1) the [Harold M. Weintraub Graduate Student Award](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/releases/2018/03/fred-hutch-announces-2018-harold-m-weintraub-graduate-student-award-recipients.html), completed her [PhD](https://education.scripps.edu/alumni/graduating-class-profiles/class-of-2018/), and accepted an independent research position in the [Scripps Fellows program](https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2018/20181107-scripps-fellows-program.html). To further enrich her technical capabilities, Danielle completed a short post-doctoral position at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in the lab of [Grant Jensen](https://jensenlab.caltech.edu/people/) to train on cutting-edge instrumentation in the exciting and emerging field of cellular cryo-electron tomography before applying these advanced methodologies to her own independent research.


Danielle returned to Scripps Research in 2019 to start her lab as a [faculty member](https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/grotjahn/) in the Department of [Integrative Structural and Computational Biology](https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/research-departments/integrative-structural-and-computational-biology/) and received a promotion to Assistant Professor in 2021. Danielle was awarded the [Damon Runyon-Rachleff Innovator Award](https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/blog/read/index.php?id=577) from the [Damon Runyon Cancer Foundation](https://www.damonrunyon.org/news/entries/6071) in 2021 to study structural mechanisms of mitochondrial fragmentation in cancer. In addition to exciting pursuits in the lab, Danielle is co-director of the Scripps Graduate Cell Biology course, a low-key yogi, a lifelong Deadhead, and a [Michael Scott](https://www.indiewire.com/2015/03/the-office-10-years-later-why-michael-scott-is-one-of-the-most-original-characters-of-all-time-248114/) aficionado.

Lillian is a rising senior pursuing her undergraduate degree in Biology with a concentration in Microbiology, Molecular, and Cell Biology at Gonzaga University. Her undergraduate research utilizes microbiologic and molecular techniques to identify the presence of Aeromonas in water sources associated with fish hatcheries and trout/salmon reintroduction points around Spokane, Washington, and investigate their diversity of virulence genes.

Lillian has joined the Grotjahn Lab as a summer intern interested in cell biology. One part of her internship project explores the interplay of mitochondrial DNA organization and the architecture of mitochondrial membranes using fluorescence microscopy. The other part focuses on understanding spatial distribution and composition of the protein translational machinery that enables neuronal plasticity by performing a three-dimensional reconstruction analysis. 

Outside the lab, Lillian enjoys swimming at the beach and antique hunting.

Nitish received his undergraduate degree with a major in Biotechnology from GGSIPU, New Delhi. He earned his PhD in the lab of Anjana Badrinarayanan at the National Centre for Biological Sciences-TIFR, Bengaluru. During his PhD, he worked on understanding how yeast cells respond to assaults on mitochondrial genomes. He developed a tool to induce mitochondria-specific DNA damage and delineated the mechanisms involved in ensuring mitochondrial genome integrity.

Nitish is interested in understanding how mitochondrial membranes remodel, especially under mitochondrial DNA stress. In the Grotjahn Lab, he aims to learn and utilize Cryo-ET to answer these questions pertaining to mitochondrial membrane architecture regulation.
 
Outside of lab, Nitish can be found looking for insects or trying to run a mile.

Michaela received her undergraduate degree in Neuroscience and Cognitive Science from the University of Arizona. As an undergraduate researcher, she used fluorescence microscopy to study aberrant cortical development in a rodent model of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Michaela then transitioned to the field of structural biology while working in the lab of Raktim Roy where she utilized mass spectrometry and x-ray crystallography to probe the structure and conformational dynamics of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases.

Michaela is now a PhD student in the Grotjahn lab at Scripps Research where she is interested in leveraging superresolution microscopy techniques to unravel the complexities of mitochondrial fission machinery under conditions of cellular stress.

While outside of the lab, Michaela enjoys slacklining, tending to her plants, and learning about disability theory and justice.

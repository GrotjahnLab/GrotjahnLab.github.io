Sam received her undergraduate degree in Biochemistry with distinction from the University of Texas at San Antonio. She completed her honors thesis in the lab of Lindsey Macpherson, studying the molecular interaction of bitter taste receptors and cognate G-proteins. In addition, she completed two summer undergraduate research fellowships at Vanderbilt University and Scripps Research in the labs of Vsevolod Gurevich and Danielle Grotjahn, respectively. 

Sam is now a joint PhD student in the Grotjahn and Wiseman Labs at Scripps Research, where she is interested in studying mitochondrial cristae remodeling and phospholipid regulation during cellular stress using superresolution microscopy and cryo-ET.

Outside of lab, Sam is a major foodie, reality tv enthusiast, and a resident beach girly.

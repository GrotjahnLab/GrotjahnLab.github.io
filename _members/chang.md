Atty received her undergraduate degree in Biological Science and Technology from National Chiao Tung University and her master’s degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from National Taiwan University in Taiwan. She then worked as research assistant in Meng-Chiao Ho’s lab at Academia Sinica, Taiwan and utilized structural techniques to investigate the interaction between the transcriptional factor Sub1A1 and DNA in rice. 

Atty explored the research abroad and continued her journey in protein structural research in Damian Ekiert/Gira Bhabha’s lab at NYU school of Medicine as a research technician. She studied the de novo designed helical proteins and the regulators of intracellular pathogen response (IPR) pathway in C. elegans by x-ray crystallography. Atty is now a PhD student in Grotjahn lab at Scripps Research Institute and study the protein import machinery on yeast mitochondria by cryo-electron tomography. 

Outside of research, Atty loves to explore new restaurant, travel, and play volleyball.

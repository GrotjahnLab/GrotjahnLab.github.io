Jessica attended Duquesne University for her undergraduate degree and completed her honors thesis the Mihailescu lab, where she studied the interactions of short RNAs that formed G quadruplexes and the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein. Her work in nucleic acid:protein interactions and utilizing various biophysical characterization techniques lead her to Brandon Ruotolo’s lab at the University of Michigan, where she developed a native mass spectrometry technique to distinguish between binding modes of small molecules and peptides to their target proteins.


Jessica is currently a postdoc in the [Williamson Lab](https://williamson.scripps.edu/) at Scripps, where she is interested in understanding how ribosomes assemble. The Williamson Lab began collaborating with the Grotjahn Lab in the summer of 2019 to understand how ribosomes assembly using in situ cryo-electron tomography to visualize where ribosomes assemble and what the ribosome intermediates look like during the process of ribosome assembly in the cell.


Outside of the lab, Jessica loves to bake and to cook, and you can often find her in local restaurants, coffee shops, and breweries.

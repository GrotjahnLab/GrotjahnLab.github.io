Ashim received his integrated Masters-PhD degree from [Prof. Roop Mallik's lab](https://www.tifr.res.in/~roop/) at TIFR, Mumbai, India. During his PhD., he worked on reconstituting organelle transport in vitro and developing optical trap-based force spectroscopy tools to measure mechanical forces on single organelles. This sparked an early interest in trying to understand the physical basis of biological processes. This led to pursuing a postdoc position in Prof. [Sivaraj Sivaramakrishnan’s lab](http://proteinacrobaticslab.umn.edu/) at University of Minnesota where he developed and used single-molecule and protein-engineering methods to investigate the structure-function mechanisms of protein complexes involved in cargo transport. In the Grotjahn lab, Ashim is combining his skills in protein-engineering and reconstitution biology to develop methods to overcome the “electron-density” barrier in cryo-electron tomography for structural mapping of small protein complexes involved in mitochondrial fission.

# Grotjahn Lab at Scripps
The Grotjahn lab investigates how cells simultaneously compartmentalize and regulate thousands of multifaceted, dynamic, and distinct processes by directly visualizing the complexity of the cell interior. Our research program focuses on understanding how mitochondrial networks change shape in response to genetic, pharmacological, or environmental cellular stress. By utilizing multidisciplinary and innovative imaging techniques, including cellular cryo-electron tomography and correlative light and electron microscopy, our lab exposes the uncharted depths of cellular landscapes to investigate how the precise organization subcellular structures regulates mitochondrial homeostasis, and how disruptions to these molecular interactions gives rise to disease pathogenesis.

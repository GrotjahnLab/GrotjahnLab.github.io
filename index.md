The Grotjahn lab research program focuses on understanding how mitochondrial networks change shape in response to genetic, pharmacological, or environmental stress. By utilizing multidisciplinary imaging techniques, including cellular cryo-electron tomography and correlative light and electron microscopy, our lab exposes the uncharted depths of cellular landscapes to define how the precise organization of subcellular structures regulates mitochondrial homeostasis, and how disruptions to these molecular interactions gives rise to disease pathogenesis.

  description: 'Danielle attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison for her undergraduate degree and completed her [honors thesis](https://cals.wisc.edu/academics/undergraduate-students/outside-the-classroom/honors-program/honors-in-research/)  in the developmental genetics lab of [Francisco Pelegri](https://pelegri.webhosting.cals.wisc.edu/). This experience sparked Danielle’s fascination with the microscopic world as she developed a system to visualize microtubule dynamics in developing zebrafish embryos using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and was instantly mesmerized by the elegant coordination between filamentous rearrangements and cell cycle progression. After graduation, Danielle continued to work in the Pelegri laboratory as a research technician, where she further refined her skills in microscopy and genetics to characterize the spatiotemporal localization patterns of the dorsal-axis determinant, [glutamate receptor interacting protein 2a](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24967891).


After spending her adolescence and early adulthood braving frigid Wisconsin winters, Danielle moved to sunny San Diego, California in 2013 to start her graduate work in [The Scripps Research Graduate Program](https://education.scripps.edu/graduate/doctoral-program/) in the laboratory of [Gabe Lander](http://www.lander-lab.com/). During the apex of cryo-electron microscopy’s [“resolution revolution”](https://www.nature.com/news/the-revolution-will-not-be-crystallized-a-new-method-sweeps-through-structural-biology-1.18335), Danielle found herself uniquely positioned as one of the few researchers at Scripps more interested in the complex interplay between macromolecular complexes and their surrounding cellular environment than chasing atomic-level details of stringently-purified proteins. Over the next four years, Danielle enthusiastically seized the opportunity to establish a cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging pipeline within the institute, and utilized these techniques to solve the [first three-dimensional structure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29416113) of the large, flexible, multi-subunit cytoplasmic [dynein](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31285262) complex bound to microtubules.



In 2018, Danielle [received](https://education.scripps.edu/graduate/about-the-graduate-school/statistics/?tab-3-contact=1) the [Harold M. Weintraub Graduate Student Award](https://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/releases/2018/03/fred-hutch-announces-2018-harold-m-weintraub-graduate-student-award-recipients.html), completed her [PhD](https://education.scripps.edu/alumni/graduating-class-profiles/class-of-2018/), and accepted an independent research position in the [Scripps Fellows program](https://www.scripps.edu/news-and-events/press-room/2018/20181107-scripps-fellows-program.html). To further enrich her technical capabilities, Danielle elected to delay the start of her fellowship to complete a short post-doctoral position at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in the laboratory of [Grant Jensen](https://jensenlab.caltech.edu/people/). This accelerated post-doctoral experience provided her with an invaluable opportunity to expand her technical expertise and train on cutting-edge instrumentation in the exciting and emerging field of *in situ* structural biology before applying these advanced methodologies to her own independent research.

Danielle returned to Scripps Research in 2019 to start her research lab as [faculty](https://www.scripps.edu/faculty/grotjahn/) in the Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology. In addition to exciting pursuits in the lab, Danielle is co-director of the Scripps Graduate Cell Biology course, a low-key yogi, a lifelong Deadhead, and a [Michael Scott](https://www.indiewire.com/2015/03/the-office-10-years-later-why-michael-scott-is-one-of-the-most-original-characters-of-all-time-248114/) aficionado.

  description: "Ben earned his PhD in James Fraser's lab at UCSF, where he developed software tools for data analysis and validation in structural biology,
                as well as experimentally investigating the mechanisms by which mammalian chitinases processively hydrolyze the prevalent polysaccharide chitin.
                Prior to that, as an undergraduate in Elizabeth Sattely’s lab at Stanford University, he investigated bacterial degradation of the polymer lignin.
                Before joining the Grotjahn lab, he worked at Genentech, where he developed software tools to automate processing of data from single particle cryo-EM.


                Ben is interested in understanding how protein structure and function is impacted by cellular contexts. His work in the lab focuses on using _in situ_
                cryoelectron tomography to determine both structure and cellular localization in parallel, and to understand how protein structure changes in different 
                cellular environments. He is particularly interested the regulation and function of proteins that polymerize in cells.


                Outside of research, he is obsessed with finding the perfect cup of coffee, a quest that has
                included learning to roast his own coffee beans."

                and post-baccalaureate research at the Salk Institute in the lab of Dmitry Lyumkis. In the lab, she utilized biochemical and single particle cryogenic electron 
                microscopy techniques to better understand the process of gamma retroviral integration. 


                Michaela joined the Grotjahn Lab at the Scripps Research Institute for her PhD, where she is interested in using the cellular cryogenic electron tomography to 
                investigate the morphological changes in mitochondria in response to cellular stress. Outside of lab, Michaela is a classically trained double bassist, an avid

  description: "Ben earned his PhD in James Fraser's lab at UCSF, where he developed software tools for data analysis and validation in structural biology,
                as well as experimentally investigating the mechanisms by which mammalian chitinases processively hydrolyzd the prevalent polysaccharide chitin.
                Prior to that, as an undergraduate in Elizabeth Sattelyâ€™s lab at Stanford University, he investigated bacterial degradation of the polymer lignin.
                Before joining the Grotjahn lab, he worked at Genentech, where he developed software tools to automate processing of data from single particle cryo-EM.


                Ben is interested in understanding how protein structure and function is impacted by cellular contexts. His work in the lab focuses on using _in situ_
                cryoelectron tomography to determine both structure and cellular localization in parallel, and to understand how protein structure changes in different 
                cellular environments. He is particularly interested the regulation and function of proteins that polymerize in cells.


                Outside of research, he is obsessed with finding the perfect cup of coffee, a quest that has
                included learning to roast his own coffee beans."

  description: "Michaela received her undergraduate degree in Biochemistry and Cell Biology from the University of California, San Diego. She conducted her undergraduate 
                and post-baccalaureate research at the Salk Institute in the lab of Dmitry Lyumkis. In the lab, she utilized biochemical and single particle cryogenic electron 
                microscopy techniques to better understand the process of gamma retroviral integration. 


                Michaela joined the Grotjahn Lab at the Scripps Research Institute for her PhD, where she is interested in using the cellular cryogenic electron tomography to 
                investigate the morphological changes in mitochondria in response to cellular stress. Outside of lab, Michaela is a classically trained double bassist, an avid 
                reader, a weekend hiker, and a foodie."
